## Glossary of terms, initialisms, and acronyms used in the OEFDB ID field

avgas - aviation gasoline - petrol-based aviation fuel

avtur - aviation turbine (or jet) fuel - kerosine-based aviation fuel

lt - less than

lte - less than or equal to

fcev - fuel cell electric vehicle - refers to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles

gt - greater than (boolean)

gte - great than or equal to (boolean)

hev - hybrid electric vehicle (non plug-in, with electric-only mode)

hvo - hydrogenated vegetable oil

me - methyl ester

mhev - mild hybrid electric vehicle (non plug-in, no electric-only mode)

na - Not available or not applicable - this is used where a given dimension of an ID either doesn't apply to that particular factor (not applicable or provided as an average and therefore not required as an identifier) or is not specified by the source (not available). We use a single value of NA in all cases to avoid large amounts of interpretation being required; the context for each NA is available in the description field of each EF. 

phev - plug-in hybrid electric vehicle
